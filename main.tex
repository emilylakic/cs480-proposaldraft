\subsection*{Answer}

Robotic Vision.

\section*{Our Idea}

\subsection*{Answer}

Our robot will actively follow a person while keeping a certain distance. If that person moves away, the robot will move until the person is as close as the specified distance again, or will rotate to keep him/her in its lenses.

\section*{Purpose}

\subsection*{Answer} 

A human-following robot has plenty of applications in daily life and manufacturing. Autonomous robots can learn to 'follow the leader' in an effort to provide as mission partners for humans, whether to assist in day-by-day tasks or for more extensive use as industrial robots operating in complex environments.

\section*{Past Research}

\subsection*{Answer}

 Human-following robots have been researched and developed actively in the past few decades. Previous research has explored several techniques such as humanâ€™s target detection, robot control algorithm, and obstacles avoidance. Various approaches have been followed, including the use of ultrasonic, voice recognition, and laser range sensors, as well as a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and so on. We will explore these possibilities in our research and development of the final project.
